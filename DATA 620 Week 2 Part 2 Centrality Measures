When considering the relationships and patterns between different types of crimes across community districts, its likely that certain CDs might have more connections to certain crime type. By using degree centrality which focuses on the number of direct connections, and eigenvector centrality which considers the quality of connections, this analysis can potentially show how crime types are distributed across community districts and further indicate additional resources and support in those areas.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"SAyfgDjdZ29Q"}}]}
